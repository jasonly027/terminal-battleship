# Building

Program requires a UNIX system to take advantage of <sys/socket.h>.
While in the terminal, type "make" to run our Makefile to create the
client and server executable.

# Playing

Server program should be run first. Follow the instructions displayed
by the program after it launches. Instructions to expect would be entering 
coordinates to place and attack ships.

The client program can be run by another user after the server has started.

The server expects connections on localhost.
